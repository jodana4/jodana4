Hello👋, my name is Joy.

I have a background in Biomedical Science 👩🏾‍🔬 and worked in this field for a while. 
I have always had a passion for facts and deriving meaningful information from data. Data is all around us and is a powerful tool for making informed decisions. 
Due to this, I decided to focus on the field of Data Analytics and Data Science 📈. Through online learning and bootcamps, I have gained proficiency in programming languages used in this field such as, SQL and Python. 
As well as, honed my skills in data cleaning, modelling, analysis and visualisation to be able to deliver meaningful insights, enabling informed business decisions.
